## opportunity-finder
Purpose: To find opportunites for folks in large organizations with a bias towards lower experieced/leveled folks helping out higher eveled folks. This helps create opportunites for new folks who may not have as much visibility in the org. 

### Author : Matt Billings 
Heavily based on Raul Gupta's https://github.com/rahulguptafullstack/node-mysql-crud-app as a starting point

### `MySQL configuration`
Please create database and make the changes in the `config/db.config.js` file.

### Create the database using
TK


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will install the dependencies inside `node_modules`

### `node server.js` OR `nodemon start` OR `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.



### Ideas for the future
* CRUD for employees/subject matter
* Ability to search on a subject/matter/goal
* Fuzzy searching
* unit tests
